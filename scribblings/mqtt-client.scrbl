@defmodule[mqtt-client]

The @racketmodname[mqtt-client] module is a Racket MQTT client implementation based on @link["https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c"]{libpaho-mqtt3}.
It allows the user to set up an MQTT client, create a connection to MQTT message broker, subscribe to topics, and to send
or receive messages. The module uses a C-based, dynamically linked library that needs to reside in the operating system.

@section{Example}

Below, we list a simple example for the way, this module might be used. To send and receive messages we set up different
contexts, two of which are mandatory: a client context and, nested in it, a connection context. Optionally, we can change
some parameters using contexts. Here, for example, we change the quality of service (QOS) when publishing to @racket[qos-1].

First, we set up a client using @racket[mqtt/with-client]. Herein, we provide the message broker's URL, @racket["localhost"],
and a client id, @racket["client1"], for our application.

Next, we set up a connection to an MQTT message broker using @link[]{mqtt/with-connection}. All connection parameters have
reasonable default values but, here, we set the keep-alive interval to @racket[20] seconds and request a clean session.

Lastly, we set the QOS for publishing to @racket[qos-1] using @racket[mqtt/with-publish-qos]. Note, the QOS for any message an
MQTT client receives is determined by the publisher and, thus, needs no parameterization on the client's part.

Within these three nested contexts, setting up a client, a connection, and default parameters (here for the QOS), we can
subscribe to topics, send messages, and wait for messages to be received. Here, we use @racket[mqtt/subscribe] to subscribe to
the topic @racket["some-topic"]. We use @racket[mqtt/publish] to publish the message @racket["Hello World"]. Finally, we
receive a message using @racket[mqtt/with-message-recv].

The form @racket[mqtt/with-message-recv] creates its own context, in which two named variables are defined designating the
topic name on which the message was received and the message payload. Here, we call these variables @racket[topic] and
@racket[payload] and display them.
