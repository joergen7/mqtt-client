@defmodule[mqtt-client]

This module is a Racket MQTT client implementation based on @link["https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c"]{libpaho-mqtt3}.
It allows the user to set up an MQTT client, create a connection to MQTT message broker, subscribe to topics, and to send
or receive messages. The module uses a C-based MQTT library that needs to reside in the operating system, the Racket
instance runs in.

@section{Example}

Below, we list a simple example for the way, this module might be used. In the example, we set up a client with
@link["MQTT_API.html#(form._((lib._mqtt-client%2Fmain..rkt)._mqtt%2Fwith-client))"]{mqtt/with-client}

@codeblock|{
#lang racket/base

(require mqtt-client)

(mqtt/with-client ("localhost" "client1")

  (mqtt/with-connection (#:keep-alive-interval 20
                         #:clean-session       #t)

    (mqtt/with-publish-qos (qos-1)
                           
      (mqtt/subscribe "some-topic")

      (mqtt/publish "some-topic" "Hello world")

      (mqtt/with-message-recv (topic payload)
        (displayln topic)
        (displayln payload)))))
